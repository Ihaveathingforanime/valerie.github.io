        <p>
            My primary goal in tech is to become a professional cybersecurity analyst.<br>
            The fragility of online data accompanied with the openness of the Internet, exposing
            one to attackers and fraudulent individuals is a major concern in recent times.<br>
            Becoming a cybersecurity analyst will let me aid them in protecting their identities, 
            data and important credentials from such harmful people.
        </p>

        <p>
            My secondary goal in tech is to become an expert and professional front-end web designer.<br>
            I love putting my creativity and focus in my programming to create appealing and 
            interacive websites for others to make use of.

        <p>
            The third goal of mine concerning tech is to become a video game developer.<br>
            Simply put, I LOVE playing video games, especially computer video games. They relieve
            a lot of stress and increase our logical and creative skills.<br>
            I'd be able to gain customers by making games that contain in-app purchases, too.

    <div class="outro">
        <p>This is the end of my simple website. I would have implemented more features,
            but seeing as I'm still a learner, I went with what I knew. I plan on expanding
            my knowledge in web development in the nearest future.
